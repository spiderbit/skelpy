Requirements
============

   - python >= 2.7

Installation
============

Over PyPi
---------
	! not working yet !
	> pip install skelpy


Installing from source
----------------------
	! not working yet!
	$ python setup.py install # may need to be root


Usage
=====

! at the moment instead of the skelpy command
! use the starter script in this folder
! just use it like descriped here but instead of:
! skelpy... use ./starter...

Create a template:
------------------

	> mkdir template1
	> cd template1
	> <create some files/directories>
	> everywhere where a file/directory/name
	  or a string should be replaced
	  by the projects name replace it with:
	  %project%

	  as example you could call a folder:
	  directory_%project%_1

	  or you could choose a filename:
	  Readme_%project%.txt

	  also you can use this substitude
	  in this or other files like that:

	  This is the readme file of the project %project%!
	  If you want to install %project% call the installer:
	  install_%project%.sh

	  To mark it for skelpy as template now run:
	  > skelpy init .


Generate a project based on this template:
------------------------------------------

	  > skelpy create <path_of_the_template> <path_of_new_project>
	  in this example:
	  > skelpy create . ~/projects/myFirstProject


Result:
-------

	  now you got a copy of the template-dir except
	  the %project% substitudes got replaced
	  by the string: "myFirstProject"


Additional Features:
====================

After a template is created, init creates a .skelpy directory
in the templates directory. you can create there a ignore file,
where you can add paths to files/directories that should not be
used for creating projects.

So if you as example want to manage the template with git,
but you dont want to use the history of the template in your
projects, you could ignore the .git directory with the command:

echo ".git" > .skelpy/ignore


Hope someone else than me finds this tool useful, too.

Have fun!
